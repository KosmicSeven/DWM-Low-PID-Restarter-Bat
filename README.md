DWM Low PID Brute-Forcer

This script forcefully restarts the Desktop Window Manager (dwm.exe) until it launches with a Process ID (PID) below 1000.

Useful for cases where certain tools or mods require dwm.exe to run with a low PID, and Windows doesn't allow you to reserve or assign PIDs directly.

⚠️ Warning

This script forcefully stops and restarts the Desktop Window Manager, which controls your graphical shell. Running it may cause flickering, temporary display issues, or even system instability. Use at your own risk.

🔧 How It Works

Kills dwm.exe

Restarts it

Checks its PID

Repeats every 10 seconds until the PID is between 1–999

🖥️ Script
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

echo Restarting Desktop Window Manager until PID < 1000...

:RESTART
taskkill /f /im dwm.exe >nul 2>&1
echo Waiting for DWM to stop...
timeout /t 5 /nobreak >nul

start "" "%SystemRoot%\System32\dwm.exe"
echo Waiting for DWM to start...
timeout /t 5 /nobreak >nul

for /f "tokens=2" %%a in ('tasklist /fi "imagename eq dwm.exe" ^| findstr "dwm.exe"') do (
    set PID=%%a
)

set PID=!PID:,=!
echo Found PID: !PID!

if !PID! lss 1000 (
    echo Success: dwm.exe is running with PID !PID!
    goto END
) else (
    echo PID !PID! is too high, retrying in 10 seconds...
    timeout /t 10 /nobreak >nul
    goto RESTART
)

:END
pause

✅ Requirements

Windows 10 or 11

Run as Administrator

📌 Notes

Typical success time: 2–10 minutes

Keep other startup processes minimal to improve chances
